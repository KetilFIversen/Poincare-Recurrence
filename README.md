# Poincare-Recurrence

This script is meant to demonstrate the phenomenon of Poincare Recurrence.
'If a transformation is applied repeatedly to a mathematical system, and the system cannot leave a bounded region, it must return
infinitely often to states near its original state.'

I saw a specific example of this phenomenon in the book 'Does God play dice?' by Ian Stewart, but I could never find any live demonstration
or any code that could replicate the behaviour shown in the figures represented in the book. Therefore, I decided to make it myself. 
I have also expanded upon the idea and added several other potential transformations one can use to play with your own images.

Note, the amount of iterations needed for recurrence to occur depends on the number of pixels of the image. Larger images take a lot longer.
And some combinations of transformations seem to never recur. 

The specific figure I am refering to can be found here; https://www.pks.mpg.de/nonlinear-dynamics-and-time-series-analysis/visualization-of-dynamical-systems/poincare-recurrences
